								Sports achievements of Kazakhstanis occupy a special place. In 1994, at the Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer, the first triumph of independent Kazakhstan in big sports took place. This was the beginning of our sports biography. Then skier Vladimir SMIRNOV<img src="resources\main\8.1.jpg" style="height: 200px; margin: 0 15px 15px 0; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 15px black; float:right;">he won the first gold for our country. In the future, Kazakhstani athletes will bring 63 more Olympic medals to the piggy bank. For 30 years, boxing has undoubtedly become the hallmark of Kazakhstan's sporting achievements. In 1996, at the XXVI Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta (Georgia, USA), the Balkhash boxer Vasily ZHIROV confidently declared himself. In addition to the title of Olympic champion, he became the owner of the most honorable prize - the Val Barker Cup, which was owned by fighters from only eight countries in the history of the Olympics. Ermakhan IBRAIMOV, Bekzat Sattarkhanov, Bakhtiar ARTAYEV, Bakyt SARSEKBAYEV, Serik SAPIYEV and Daniyar YELEUSINOV became the same unsurpassed gold-bearing boxers in their sport. A special line should be marked with the name of Gennady GOLOVKIN.<img src="resources\main\8.2.jpg" style="height: 200px; margin: 0 15px 15px 0; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 15px black; float:left;">His name is heard not only among our compatriots. Gennady has 41 victories on his account. In 2016, Golovkin entered the Guinness Book of Records. He became the world champion with the highest percentage of wins by knockout – 91.67%. GGG - the abbreviation has become a world-famous brand. Gennady Golovkin enters the ring in the national Kazakh chapan, and it has become a tradition. Also, over 30 years of independence, athletes, wrestlers, swimmers, weightlifters, cyclists, figure skaters and biathletes have brought success to Kazakhstan's sport. The weightlifting school has nurtured a large number of champion weightlifters over the years of independence. In 1996 Anatoly KHRAPATY<img src="resources\main\8.3.jpg" style="height: 200px; margin: 0 15px 15px 0; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 15px black; float:right;">he brought Kazakhstan the first gold at the World Championship.
