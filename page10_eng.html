								Major transformations and reforms have affected the education system. Currently, there are 120 universities in Kazakhstan, 11 of them national, 29 state, there are also civil military universities, one international and autonomous organization is Nazarbayev University, 17 are corporatized, the rest are private. If we compare with 1991, the number of universities has doubled, in 1991 there were only 61 universities. Over the years of independence, more than 3 million personnel with higher education have been trained, and the graduation of specialties in 1991 amounted to more than 42 thousand. And already in 2020, their number has tripled – 153 thousand people. The capacity of universities has also increased significantly, the quality of the teaching staff has changed. At the beginning of the noughties, the settling of teachers was 24 percent, and already in 2020 it has doubled and is about 50 percent. Foreign scientists and top managers who introduce the best world practice to universities are invited to Kazakh universities. It is especially necessary to note the international program "Bolashak", thanks to which talented Kazakhstanis can get an education at the expense of the state in the best universities in the world, so that they can then apply their knowledge for the benefit of our country.
