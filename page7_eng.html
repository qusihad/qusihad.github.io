								One of the most important successes of Kazakhstan is the transfer of the capital from the city of Almaty to the city of Nur-Sultan (at that time Akmola) in December 1997. And already in 1999, the capital of Kazakhstan was awarded the UNESCO City of Peace Award. It is assigned to new cities of the planet that have achieved high results in socio-economic, political and cultural development in a short period of time. Nur-Sultan is a center of political, educational, scientific and cultural events. Today it has turned into a thriving metropolis. Nur-Sultan is a city of young people. The flagships of national education are located here: Nazarbayev University, L. Gumilev Eurasian National University, Kazakh National University of Arts, S. Seifullin Kazakh Agrotechnical University, Kazakhstan branch of Lomonosov Moscow State University, Astana Medical University and others. The Baiterek complex has become the hallmark of the new capital. In 2002, the Astana-Baiterek monument was awarded the Grand Prix award following a competition held by the International Association of the Union of Architects of the CIS countries. Other unique architectural structures include the Palace of Peace and Harmony, designed by the famous British architect Norman FOSTER, and the Khan Shatyr shopping and entertainment center, made in the form of a pyramid – the tallest tent structure in the world, the oceanarium "Duman", the opera and Ballet Theater "Astana Opera", the largest mosque in Central Asia "Hazret Sultan", the Cathedral in honor of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Archdiocese of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the synagogue "Beit Rachel Chabad Lubavitch", the Central Concert Hall "Kazakhstan", the monument "Kazakh Eli", the Museum of Modern Art and the Presidential Cultural Center. Among the sports facilities of Nur-Sultan are the indoor stadium "Astana Arena" for 30 thousand spectators, the unique bike track "Saryarka" for 10 thousand seats, recognized in 2011 as the best in the world. Another important sports complex is the Alau Ice Palace, which meets all international standards. In terms of construction volumes, the capital is the leader in the country. More than 10 million square meters of housing have been built in Nur-Sultan. The author of the capital's general plan was the famous Japanese architect Kise KUROKAWA.
