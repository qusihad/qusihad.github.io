								Together with sovereignty, we got the opportunity to revive our national culture, culture and traditions of other ethnic groups inhabiting Kazakhstan. In total, 25 new theaters and concert halls have been opened over the years, about 1,000 new museums and libraries have been created, unique cultural educational organizations operate, including the Kazakh National University of Arts, the T. Zhurgenev National Academy of Arts, the Kurmangazy National Conservatory, the National Academy of Choreography. The 1990s-2000s became a new stage in the history of the Kazakh national culture. During these years, the Nauryz holiday and the art of musical and poetic improvisation - aitys akynov – were revived. New international festivals and competitions have been born. Competitions "Asia dauysy", "Ukili dombra", "Zhigit Sultan", "Kyz sons", "Zhas Kanat" were held in Almaty. The mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi, the archaeological complex "Tamgaly", as well as the natural heritage site "Saryarka – steppes and lakes of Northern Kazakhstan" are included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List. Over the years of sovereignty in the country, more than 25 types of Kazakh national sports have become popular again. Such competitions as Kazakh kuresi, sayatshylyk, asyk atu and togyzkumalak were included in the Representative List of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, and the republican tournament "Kazakhstan Barysy" became a national brand.
