								On March 2, 1992, Kazakhstan joined the UN. Following the results of the 46th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Republic of Kazakhstan was unanimously accepted as a member of the UN by resolution. During the period of independence, the republic has become a member of authoritative and influential international organizations – the UN, OSCE, OIC, SCO, CIS, EAEU, CES, CSTO, OECD. As you know, in December 2010, Kazakhstan became the first post-Soviet state, the first representative of Central Asia to be entrusted with the OSCE chairmanship. Its holding strengthened the authority of the country and the First President in the international arena. In 2012, Kazakhstan was among the 50 most competitive countries in the world in the global report of the World Economic Forum 2013-2014. 2014 was marked by the signing of the treaty on the establishment of the Eurasian Economic Union. In 2017, Kazakhstan became the first country of the former USSR to host the International Specialized Exhibition EXPO. Approximately four million people attended the exhibition, of which half a million came from foreign countries. The exhibition was dedicated to the theme "Future Energy", in total 115 states and 22 international organizations took part in it. Since July 2018, the Astana International Financial Center, located in the EXPO exhibition Complex, has started its work. The center has become a kind of financial magnet for investment capital. The AIFC connects the economies of Central Asia, the Caucasus, the EAEU, Western China, Mongolia, the Middle East and Europe.
